## 🧩 What I Build

I build and connect systems — from small game scripts to entire company architectures.  
My work spans both **creative** and **technical** dimensions:

| Layer | Project | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| ⚙️ **Frameworks** | [**Solvyn**](https://solvyn.dev) | Schema-driven PHP framework that generates models, controllers and docs from SQL. |
| 📊 **Automation** | [**Metrics Dynamics**](https://metricsdynamics.com) | SaaS platform for SEO, GEO and data automation. |
| 🛵 **Commerce** | [**Scooter Dynamics**](https://scooterdynamics.com) | Smart mobility retail & logistics brand. |
| 🏢 **Holding** | [**Trednets BV**](https://trednets.com) | Corporate backbone — IP ownership, structure, continuity. |
| 🎭 **Creative IP** | [**Onore Online**](https://onore.online) | Browser-based underworld RPG — experimental economy & society simulator. |
| 📚 **Open Source** | [**Syslogine**](https://syslogine.com) | Knowledge hub, tutorials, and dev research space. |

## 🔧 Modding & Origins

Before frameworks and companies, I started by **modding games** —  
creating custom **FiveM** and **GTA V** scripts, building roleplay frameworks and gameplay systems.

That passion for modifying systems never left.  
It evolved from “editing Lua scripts” into “editing the real world” —  
architecting companies, APIs and frameworks with the same curiosity.

> 🧠 *Modding taught me that every system can be understood — and therefore, redesigned.*

I still maintain and experiment with open-source modding tools, utilities and sandbox projects here on GitHub.  
You’ll find repositories ranging from **game scripting**, **automation logic**, to **infrastructure orchestration**.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> *“Build to endure, not to exit.”*  

My approach blends engineering and artistry — systems should be efficient, elegant, and timeless.  
From game code to legal structures, I try to make every layer consistent, documented and scalable.
