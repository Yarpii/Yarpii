## 🧩 What I Build

I build and connect systems — from small game scripts to entire company architectures.  
My work bridges **engineering**, **design**, and **strategy** — every layer built to reinforce the next.

## 🔧 Modding & Origins

Before frameworks and companies, I started by **modding games** —  
creating custom **FiveM** and **GTA V** scripts, building roleplay frameworks and gameplay systems.

That passion for modifying systems never left.  
It evolved from “editing Lua scripts” into “editing the real world” —  
architecting companies, APIs and frameworks with the same curiosity.

> 🧠 *Modding taught me that every system can be understood — and therefore, redesigned.*

I still experiment with open-source modding tools, automation logic and infrastructure orchestration.  
Those early experiences shaped the modular and generative philosophy behind Structbrew.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> *“Build to endure, not to exit.”*

Systems should be efficient, elegant, and timeless.  
From game code to corporate architecture, I design every layer to be self-documenting, modular and scalable —  
bridging creativity and precision, curiosity and structure.
